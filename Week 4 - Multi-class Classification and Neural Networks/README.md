# Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
Multi-class Classification is logistic regression that involves multiple classes. Neural Networks is an algorithm that tries to mimic the brain and it is mainly used for complex and non-linear hypotheses. Neural networks are also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs). This solution was created by using Octave for the Week 4 Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks assignment for Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Stanford University. 

# Topics Covered 
- Multi-class Classification (Logistic Regression that involves more than two classes)
- Neural Networks (An algorithm that tries to mimic the brain)
- Input Layer (Layer of nodes that represent the inputs)
- Hidden Layer (Layer of nodes between the input layer and output layer) 
- Output Layer (Layer of nodes that represent the output)
- Forward Propagation (Input data is fed in the forward direction through the neural networks)

# Information about Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
## Part 1: Multi-class Classification 
For this exercise, you will use logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. This exercise will show you how the methods youâ€™ve learned can be used for this classification task.

In the first part of the exercise, you will extend your previous implementation of logistic regression and apply it to one-vs-all classification.

## Part 2: Neural Networks
In the previous part of this exercise, you implemented multi-class logistic regression to recognize handwritten digits. However, logistic regression cannot form more complex hypotheses as it is only a linear classifier.

In this part of the exercise, you will implement a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the same training set as before. The neural network will be able to represent complex models that form non-linear hypotheses. For this week, you will be using parameters from a neural network that we have already trained. Your goal is to implement the feedforward propagation algorithm to use our weights for prediction.

The neural network model is as shown below:

# Conclusion 
The accuracy for Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks are 94.78 and 97.52, respectively. Neural network has higher accuracy because it can form more complex and non-linear hypotheses as compared to multi-class classification.
