# Support Vector Machines 
Support Vector Machines is a supervised learning model used to analyze complex non-linear functions. This solution was created by using Octave for the Week 7 - Support Vector Machines for Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Stanford University. 

# Topics Covered 
- Support Vector Machines (Supervised learning model used to analyze complex non-linear function)
- Large Margin Classifier (Another term for support vector machines; support vector machines will find a decision boundary that has the largest margin)
- Kernels (To compute the dot product of two vectors x and y in some feature space)
- Gaussian Kernel (To transform the dot product in the infinite-dimensional space into the Gaussian function of the distance between points in the data space)

# Information about Support Vector Machines and Spam Classifier 
## Part 1: Support Vector Machines
In the first half of this exercise, you will be using support vector machines (SVMs) with various example 2D datasets. Experimenting with these datasets will help you gain an intuition of how SVMs work and how to use a Gaussian kernel with SVMs. 

## Part 2: Spam Classifier 
In this part, you will be using support vector machines to build a spam classifier.
