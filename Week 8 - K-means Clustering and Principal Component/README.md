# K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis
Unsupervised Learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. Examples of unsupervised learning are K-means Clustering and Dimensionality reduction. K-means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that cluster the unlabeled data into K-groups. Principal Component Analysis is used for data compression to speed up learning algorithms by mapping high dimensional features x to lwoer dimensional representation z. This solution was created by using Octave for the Week 8 - K-means Clustering and Principal Component for Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Stanford University. 

# Topics Covered 
- Unsupervised Learning (A type of algorithm that learns patterns from unlabelled data)
- K-means Clustering (An unsupervised learning algorithm that groups unlabelled data into K-groups)
- Dimensionality Reduction (An unsupervised learning algorithm that reduce a high dimensional features x to lower dimensional representation z)
- Principal Components Analysis (To speed up learning algorithm, to compress the data, or to visualize the data)
- Random Initialization (To randomly initialize the centroid to the training data for K-means Clustering)
- Elbow Method (To identify how many clusters that have to be chosen for K-means Clustering)

# Information about K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis
## Part 1: K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis
In this this exercise, you will implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression. You will first start on an example 2D dataset that will help you gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. After that, you wil use the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.



## Part 2: Principal Component Analysis




## Part 1: Support Vector Machines
In the first half of this exercise, you will be using support vector machines (SVMs) with various example 2D datasets. Experimenting with these datasets will help you gain an intuition of how SVMs work and how to use a Gaussian kernel with SVMs. 

## Part 2: Spam Classifier 
In this part, you will be using support vector machines to build a spam classifier.
